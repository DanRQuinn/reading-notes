Communicate and ask questions, think out loud and ask if things make sense. Essentially don't be quiet.

One thong that really stuck out to me wans that the code and seudo code isn't as important as the thought process. The other thing that stuck out to me was that you should ask questions and make sure you understand the problem. 

- What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?
