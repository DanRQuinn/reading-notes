## Pain and Suffering

From: [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

- In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

This is important because we will all soon be going into this crazy 10 week experiance and it will likely be the hardest 10 weeks of our lifes. Personally I have a fiance and a 7 year old and 2 dogs and the section about forgetting to work out really got me. In 201 and 301 I didn't forget to work out I straight up didn't have time. Any free time I can was spent trying to catch up on household tasks which I kept falling behind in. I know this will be ten weeks of 14 hour days and no free time and 2 thing I will do to survive is stick to a strict scedule and rememer to eat everyday. The last 2 weeks of 301 I usually wouldn't have time to eat until 8 or 9 at night and that gets hard after you do that too many days in a row.
