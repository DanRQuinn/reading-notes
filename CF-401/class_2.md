## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

From: [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

This topic is important as we go into tests and understanding working backwords from the test. I think the article is a little dated though. In this day and age I think it is innappropriate to assume names have a gender assigned to them.

## If name equals main

From: [If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

This topic is important because we want to know where the Pthon file is coming from and if it is being important it will behave difffently.


## Recursion

From: [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)

This topic is important because we want to consolodate our code. Recursion helps with this proccess.

## Questions and Summary

- What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

The tests are written before the code. The tests are used to write a minimum amount of code to pass. By writing the tests first you begin to think about the requirements of the test. TDD also prevents bugs by writing the test first you can be sure the code you made passes the test.

- Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

It is used to execute code only when the script is run as the main program. This can be useful for separating code that should only be run when the script is run directly, from code that can also be imported and used by other scripts.

- Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

In Python, recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. This can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional iterative methods.

- What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

A module is a single Python file. It can be imported into other Python programs. A package is a collection of python modules that are organized into a directory.Packages can be imported intoother Python programs and used to access modules in them.
