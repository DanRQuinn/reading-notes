This topic will be important as we get into deeper pythonic math.

## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

From: [What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

As we develope new code and projects we want to be thinking about risk analysis from the jump so it doesn't come back and bite us later.

## TestCoverage

From: [TestCoverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)

We have all been working on tests recently Kim has pointed out that some of our tests are usless or redundant. Making goo tests is very important and we will want to make sure we are not just makeing tests for the sake of making tests.

## Big O Notation

From: [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

This reading is important because I think we are all still a little shakey on what the big O actually means. We need to get past basic understanding and be able to accuratly reconize what the n is for different code.

## Questions

- How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

The random module is used to generate random numbers or make random selections. the randint() function, the random() function, the choice() function, the randrange() function, and the shuffle() function are the most common functions availible.

- In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

It means assessing the risk at the begining of the project so the devs can keep that in mind and fix it while building the project not trying to fix it as an after thought and possible breaking something.

- What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

Its how much of the code the tests cover. Its important because we want the tests to cover all scenarios but if test coverage is a requirement the devs might just make easy tests. Its important to not just cover as much code as possible but to also make sure that they are good tests.

- What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity

Big O notation is used to describe algorithmic efficiency, you could use big O in the real world to look at a shopping list and how many items you would have to check off.
