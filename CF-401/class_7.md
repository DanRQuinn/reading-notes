## Python Scope

From: [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)

This topic is important as we will start having more variables in different places and we will want to know how and where to acceess variables inside other funtions.

## Big O notation is simpler than you might think

From: [Big O notation is simpler than you might think]()

I know this is important but I am still wrapping my head around big O and thats why its important to keep watching videos like this that simplify it.

## Basic Programming With Python

From: [Basic Programming With Python](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Basic_Programming_With_Python#Program_Example_1_3)

This reading is important because with our farkle project we will be doing a lot of dice rolling and this article has a lot of good code examples on how to do that.

## Questions

- Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

Variable scope is where in a program the variables can be accessed. Local variables are defined within a function or class and can only be accessed within that function or class. Global variables are defined outside of any function or class and can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Nonlocal variables are defined in an inner scope, but are also defined in an outer scope and can be accessed from both scopes.

- How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

They  are used to access variables from other scopes in Python. global and nonlocal keywords are useful in situations where you need to access variables from other scopes.

- In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.

Big O notation is a way of measuring how long an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases. It is important because it allows us to compare the performance of different algorithms and to choose the most efficient one for a particular task.

- Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.

You would have to establish a count and compare that to the predicted percentage.
