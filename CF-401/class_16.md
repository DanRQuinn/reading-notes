# Serverless Functions

## Questions

- What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider takes care of the provisioning and management of servers. This frees up developers to focus on writing code and deploying applications, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Serverless computing differs from traditional server-based architectures in that there are no physical servers to manage, and resources are only provisioned when needed. This can lead to significant cost savings and increased scalability.

- How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

Vercel is a platform that makes it easy to deploy serverless functions. To get started with Vercel, you first need to create an account. Once you have an account, you can create a new project and select the "Function" template. You will then need to provide some basic information about your function, such as the name, programming language, and runtime. Once you have created your function, you can deploy it by clicking the "Deploy" button. Vercel will then take care of provisioning the necessary resources and deploying your function to the cloud.

- What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions and procedures that allow two pieces of software to communicate with each other. APIs can be used in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources. For example, you could use an API to get the latest stock prices from a financial website, or to retrieve information about a product from an online store.

- What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library is a Python library that makes it easy to send HTTP requests. You can use Requests to interact with APIs by sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. For example, you could use Requests to send a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve information about a specific user.
