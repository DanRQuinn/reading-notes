# Linked Lists

## Vocablulary/Definition list

- Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

- Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

- Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

- Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

- Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

- Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

- Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

- linear data structures - When there is a sequential order to your data structure.

- non-linear data structures - items is an object that don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

- circular linked list - a list that doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value. Instead, it has a node that acts as the tail of the list (rather than the conventional head node), and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list
