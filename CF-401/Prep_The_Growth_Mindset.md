This topic is important because even though we are getting tons of practice now we aren't really refining any skills just pileing on new ones. Once we are done with 401 we will need to stay practiced and up to date with the tech world.

The article talks about practice and repating projects that were hard or difficut. at one point it compares practicing code to practicing piano. As a mnusicain I know for a fact the negative impacts of "getting rusty" and the positives of weekly or even daily practice of the things you don't really want to work on.

This topic is important because we so often set ceiling for ourselfs. Its important to look at these celings as optainable goals in the long run, even if there are many steps along the way. I am currently trying to teach my 7 year old block Python and she wants to build a game but we have to start with building the more simple greeting cards.

The video talks about the growth midset and embracing challages. Failure can be scary but making mistakes eventually leads to making improvements. She talks about raising children to behave like this greeting the challenges to create continuous improvement instead of constant validation. When certain kids are praised for achevements and goals the other student may become discoraged because they have not gotten there "yet", effort and difficulty are things to be seen as opportunities for brain development.

From:[Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/c)

This topic is important because we will all soon be heading out into a competative job market. I know personally  I am worried about wether I have what it takes to compete with AI coders, and grit will be needed to survive the next generation of technology.

In the video Angela talks about the importace of grit. She defines it as passion and perserverance for long term goals. IQ is no longer the sole indecator of acheivement. SHe point out that people with lower IQ scores but higher dive we able to succed where the higher IQs struggled. Unfotunatly we don't currently have a great grasp of how to develope grit but we might try by developing a growth midset and that yearing will come with the process. Over all she wants more focus on developing grit in childern.

### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

From:[Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

This topic is important because we all know what job anxiety can feel like. Are we were we should be in life right now(for me its always been no), what do my friends/significant other really think of my career(also in this case my spose has thought since the day she met me I should have a better job). Unless I get a great job right out of the gate these will probably be anxieties that stick with me for a while.

Alain talks about snobbey and how its is becoming more common for people to be judged based on their career. The question what do you do can lead people to make judgments about your level of sucess as a person and how well you are doing in life. Stacking material and luxury thing is also a sign of success. In short our culture burdens people with high expectations and the anxiety as a result can be overwhelming. It is important to understand where peopoe come from and have compassion for everyone.

Based off of the assesment I need to be more self aware. I tend to look off camera in zoom meetings and fidget and do things that might seem like I am distracted. Even though I know that I'm listening its important that other people feel heard. For those reasons I want to improve the way I present on camera and seem more focused and less distracted.

I got a good score overall. Although I am a straight white male my daughter is black, and we talk about these issues constantly as part of raising her in a country with so many race/equity issues. I will note that I wasn't always so aware and getting to this point took many times where my ignoance was pointed out and I had to quell my feelings of embarassment. In that moment listening is always more important that how you feel.
