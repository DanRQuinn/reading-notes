## Classes and Objects

From: [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

This topic is important because we have already learned these things in JavaScript, now we have to learn the similarities and differences.

## Thinking Recursively

From: [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

This topic is important because we have been talking a lot about recursion and I feel like we still don't have a full grasp of the concept. I read the article and the demo where they split the eles work makes sense when I read the paragraph and looked at the graphic but the code didn't really make sense to me.

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

From: [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)

This topic is important because we want to be testing all of our python code, not just in this class but going forward in our careers. TDD is the genral idea of the article although I got lost in the code and what is was actually doing in the examples.

## Questions

- What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

The class is like the blueprints for creating objects. Objects are like the instances that we learned in 301. The class is the general layout of the object and the object is the specifics.

- Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

Recursion is when instead of itterating through an array you divide it in half to search through it faster. A good exapmle is our code challenge yeter day where we cut the array in half and used high/low/mid to hone in on the number getting there in less steps.

- What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fixtures are a way to write multiple test quickly. Code coverage is how much the tests cover. When used together properly this can save alot of development time.This also gives the dev confidance that their code is working.
