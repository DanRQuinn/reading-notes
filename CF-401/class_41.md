## Ethics in the workplace

Google responded to employee protests by pledging not to use AI for weaponry or surveillance, spurred by concerns over Project Maven's military involvement. CEO Sundar Pichai established AI principles to guide ethical use. Google now aims to develop beneficial AI that avoids harm. Though avoiding harmful projects, Google will collaborate with the U.S. military for non-offensive tasks. Some employees see this as a positive step but question future prevention, desiring more transparency and ethical cooperation with groups like the United Nations. This reflects the challenge of balancing tech advancement and ethics, emphasizing the importance of implementing AI principles.

Manufacturers are working on defenses, and the government's role in ensuring secure coding practices is crucial. Startups are also addressing security, but claims should be approached with caution.
