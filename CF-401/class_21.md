## Questions

- What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

The key components of the Django framework are models, views, templates, and URLs. These components work together to store data, handle requests, render HTML pages, and map incoming requests to views. This allows developers to build web applications that are efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

- Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

Django's MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture separates the concerns of data (models), presentation (views), and layout (templates). This makes it easier to develop and maintain web applications, as well as to scale them to handle large amounts of traffic.

- What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?
