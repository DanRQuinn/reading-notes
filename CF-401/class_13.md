## Questions

- Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear regression is a statistical method to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. It is used in machine learning and data analysis to find the relationship between variables, make predictions, and identify outliers. Linear regression is a powerful algorithm that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

- Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

To implement a linear regression model in Python, we need to import the necessary libraries, load the data, split the data, create a model, fit the model, make predictions, and evaluate the model. The Scikit Learn library provides a linear regression model that can be used to implement a linear regression model in Python The steps involved in implementing a linear regression model in Python using the Scikit Learn library are: import, load, split, create, fit, predict, and evaluate.

- What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?
