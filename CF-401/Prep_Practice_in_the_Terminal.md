# Prep: Practice in the terminal

## Reading and videos

### The Command Line

From:[The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

There was not alot here that I haven't been using consistantly through 301. When I did the $SHELL command my result had zsh instead of bash. I'm not sure if that is a issue.

### Basic Navigation

From:[Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)

Another section where I was pretty familiar with the material. One thing that I did learn was -l, and all the commands that can go after it.

### More About Files

From:[More About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

I didn't know that not everything is a file. Even the keyboard and the moniter. Spaces and case sensitivity are key I think I already knew this but needed a reminder. I remember using -a to look at our .env files and other hidden files.

### Manual Pages

From:[Manual Pages](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php)

I had never heard of the man command before. It was fun to play around with. I feel like I would like to use it more although I might be stuck in my ways.

### File Manipulation

From:[File Manipulation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php)

mkdir and touch are commands that I love and try to use over the way I used to which was through the finder. Now I try not to use my finder when possible.

### Cheat Sheet

From:[Cheat Sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php)

This is making the bookmarks bar and will be referanced often. I imagine this will save me alot of time waiting for TAs in canvas when the answer is all right here.
