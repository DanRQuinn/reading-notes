## Questions

- What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Lab is a newer and more advanced version of Jupyter Notebook. It has a more modern user interface and includes a number of additional features, such as a file browser, terminal, code editor, and debugger.

- What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

The NumPy library is a powerful tool for scientific computing and data manipulation in Python. It provides a number of functionalities, such as N-dimensional array objects, mathematical functions, linear algebra operations, random number generation, and data I/O. NumPy arrays are a fundamental data structure in NumPy. They are similar to Python lists, but they are optimized for numerical operations.

- Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

NumPy arrays are a multidimensional array object that can store data of any type. They are similar to Python lists, but they are optimized for numerical operations. NumPy arrays can be created using the np.array() function. NumPy arrays can be manipulated using a variety of methods, such as append(), sort(), and mean().
