# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Reading and videos

### Basic Recursion

From:[Basic Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

This topic is important because we will be using recursion in the near future. Recursion is often prefered because it is easier to understand but there is no Increase in preformance. Understanding Recursion is important because we will see it a lot.

### Data Structures in 15 Minutes

From:[Data Structures in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

This topic is important because it lays the foundation for our further study of data stuctures and algorythms. The video talks abou the most important data structures linked lists, arrays, hash tables, stacks, queues, and graphs.

### Big O Explained

From:[Big O Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

This topic is important because in 201 and 301 we were not concerned about the efficiancy of the code that we wrote. Going forward this will be more important. The video talks about the importance of adding runtimes of different steps, dropping constants, using different variables for different inputs, and dropping non-dominant terms.

### Basic Data Structures

From:[Basic Data Structures](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42)

This topic is important because there are the formats for what we will be using going forward. Below is a breif summary of the topics.

- Arrays are a fixed-size data structure that can store elements of the same data type. They are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

- Linked lists are a dynamic data structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Insertion and deletion of elements in a linked list is easier than in an array.

- Stacks are a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

- Queues are a FIFO (first in, first out) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the front of the queue.

- Hash tables are a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. The hash function is used to map a key to a value.

- Trees are a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes and edges. Nodes store data and edges connect nodes.

- Heaps are a special type of tree where the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their children.

### Why Big O

From:[Why Big O](https://web.archive.org/web/20230207075759/https://triplebyte.com/blog/why-you-should-learn-big-o-and-stop-hacking-your-way-through-algorithms)

This topic is important because we want to make our code simple and efficiant. More complexx code tends to lead to mistakes and uses up more proccessing power.

## Questions and Summary

- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

What types of operations are going to be preformed on the data. What format would do that best?

- How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

limit the amout of recursive calls and use a non recursive algorythm.
