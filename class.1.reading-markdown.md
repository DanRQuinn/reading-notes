## Headings

Always need a space between hashtags. and blank line before and after.

`# =h1 ## =h3 ect.`

`Heading level 1

===============`

`Heading level 2

---------------`

## Text edits

to create paragraphs seperate text with a empty line. no spaces at the beginning. for a line break <br> use two spaces then return, can also just use <br>

` & dragonfly` does nothing

`**bold text** __bold text__ Love**is**bold=Loveisbold`

`*Italic text* _italic text_ A*cat*meow=Acatmeow`

`for bold and italic= This text is ***really important***.`  

`this text is ___really important___`  

`his text is __*really important*__.`  

`This text is **_really important_**.`  

`This is really***very***important text.`

for lists use `1. 2. 3. ect.` or - + or * for unorded lists

when starting with a number `- 1968\. A great year!`
`- I think 1969 was second best.`

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
