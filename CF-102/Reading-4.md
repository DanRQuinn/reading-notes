## Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product

Invision, or Balsamiq for wire frame templates or draw by hand

Wireframe is basically a blueprint for your website

![Example wireframe](samuel-student-wireframe---x----972-715x---.png)

Suggested planning routes:

 Wireframe > Interactive Prototype >

 Visual > Design

Sketch > Code

Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code

Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

Six steps:

Do your research

Prepare your research for quick reference

Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

 Add some detail and get testing

 Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

 3 key priciples:

 Clarity

 Confidence

 Simplicity

## HTML Basics

 From: [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

 Opening and closing tags for everything content goes in the middle example:

 `<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>`

 Opening tag can also have content atributes with the name of `<p attribute="value of atribute">`

This is a nested element in the example very has nested attributes

 `<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>`

This is a void element it is standalone with no closing tag

`<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />`

`<h1-6></h1-6>` for different sized headings

to add a link use `<a href="url">Title text</a>`

For ordered lists use `<ol></ol>`

For unordered lists use `<ul></ul>`

each item goes inside `<li></li>`

`<strong></strong>` this makes context strong

`<em></em>` this makes it emphazized

Page structure:

`<body>`

`<header></header>`

`<main></main>`

`<Footer></Footer>` for tab at bottom of the page

`</body>`

## Semantics

From: [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

Use the correct elememt even though you can make a paraghraph look like a heading it will have no semantic value

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)

- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page

- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
