### Objects

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

Its a link to a list of things to do when you get to the object pulling the information that shows on screen from the object source.

- What are some advantages to creating object literals?

You can makes objects without writing alot of code and it will show on screen how you write it.

- How do objects differ from arrays?

An array is acollection of elements while an object has a bunch of values.

- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

When you need to acces object properties like the city in our objects on lab 6.

- Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

The name and the age of the dog. You could use this object with different dogs information.

## Introduction to the DOM

From: [Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

### What is a DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

- What is the DOM?

Its a selection tool that allows you to create HTML elements using a id selector tag.

- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

JavaScript is the language used to manipulate theDOM telling it what to do and what elements to create.
