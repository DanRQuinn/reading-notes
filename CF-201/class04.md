## Creating hyperlinks

From:[Creating hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

 basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an `<a>` element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

As mentioned before, almost any content can be made into a link, even block-level elements. If you want to make a heading element a link then wrap it in an anchor (`<a>`) element as shown in the following code snippet:

`<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">`
  `<h1>MDN Web Docs</h1>`
`</a>`
`<p>Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, since 2005.</p>`

If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the `<a>` element to wrap the image file referenced with the `<img>` element.

`<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">`
  `<img src="mdn_logo.svg" alt="MDN Web Docs homepage" />`
`</a>`
