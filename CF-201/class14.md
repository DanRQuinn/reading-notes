## Transforms

From:[Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. Weâ€™ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

- What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

It allows the developer to use 2 to 3 dimentional axies to distort and transform the element.

- Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

You could use rotate to simulate the turning of a knob.
