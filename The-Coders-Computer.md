## Choosing a Text editor

When choosing a text editor it is important to think about personal preferance. Many editors are capable of coding but picking one that works for you is important.

Color coding and interface and even the theme can make it easier to navigate or easier on the eyes.

The only way to find out is to get your hands dirty, experimentation with various text editors will help you find your favorite, even if they all do about the same thing.

Main features: 

"1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them"

Text Edit doesnt have all the features that many third party text editors have.

Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text are all good options.

## The Command Line

"A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text."
