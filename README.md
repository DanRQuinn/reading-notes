What growth midset means to me is that you are steady evolving and adapting to the situation or problem at hand.

**3 reminders to stay in a Growth Midset**

1.A baby experiances many failures in its attempts to walk, yet it persits until it is in fact good at walking.

2.A tree has many stages from seed to adult. Through all types of weather it will become stronger and continue to reach for the sky.

3.When learning a new language forming a sentance can be very difficult. As you increase your vocabulary sentances and even convorsations become possible!
