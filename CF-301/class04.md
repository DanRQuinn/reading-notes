- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

No, because it can be more interactive for the user, save their imput if the lose the page, and help the form process faster.
- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

We need to access the value property of the event target.

Because it is shorter code and easier to read.

- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

`
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
`
